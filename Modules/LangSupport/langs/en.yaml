hi: |
  Hello {user}! 👋
  Welcome to *TrackMiner!*.
  To download a song, you'll need to send a YouTube link and I'll shortly send you the song in M4A format.
  If you ever have any questions, feel free to use the /help command 😊
  Remember that you can use /lang to set your own language!
  And /active to check if the bot is running!

  I only accept YouTube links that start with:
